Following my pursuit to become a data scientist, I have created this repository to showcase some relevant work I have been doing as part of my studies, tests and projects included in my master's degree at IMF Smart Education in Madrid, Spain.

Information included is public as it can be retreived from sites such as Kaggle, Wikimedia Commons or any other indicated.

Topics that I'll be showing include EDA, visualization, statistics, Machine Learning modeling, big data and more.

I'm happy to hear any comments or suggestions on how to improve my code writting and development.
